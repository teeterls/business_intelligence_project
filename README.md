# business_intelligence_project
Business Intelligence Project - Machine Learning Algorithms and other tools (developed in R) to analyse banking data and draw conclusions about the results of a recent marketing campaign by a Portuguese entity, in which a term deposit is offered.
The aim of this project is to predict if a client will subscribe or not to financial product offered by the bank. For this purpose, several machine learning algorithms used for classification, both supervised and unsupervised are implemented:
- Association rules
- Clustering or group analysis: Hierarchical clustering, KNN, K-Means.
- Decision trees: C4.5, CART, Ensembles (Bagging: Random Forest)
- Neural networks: Kohonen Maps (SOM), MLP, RBF
- Fuzzy logic
